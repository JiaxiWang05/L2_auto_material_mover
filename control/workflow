Define_Data_Processing_Requirements:
   1. Calculate processing speed required for real-time sensor data handling.
   2. Specify requirements for energy consumption, memory, and interface compatibility.

      SELECT microcontroller = NVIDIA Jetson
         // Note: Best for AI tasks such as computer vision.

   ELSE:
