# L2_auto_material_mover
This design project outlines the development of an automated material mover; designed to move up to two tonnes of load around a factory environment. Elements of the factory design are to be considered. This may result in a range of parameters that combined with the material mover itself produces a commercially viable goods handling ecosystem.
